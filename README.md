# Concurrent Multi-Client Communication System in C

This project involves architecting and implementing a scalable concurrent multi-client communication system in C. The system integrates inter-process communication, shared memory, mutex synchronization, and efficient resource management techniques. Leveraging multithreading, it distributes client loads onto individual threads to support seamless concurrent operations.

## Features

- Scalable and concurrent multi-client communication system.
- Inter-process communication (IPC) for efficient data exchange between clients and the server.
- Shared memory usage to facilitate faster data access and sharing between processes.
- Mutex synchronization to ensure thread safety and prevent data conflicts in a multi-client environment.
- Efficient resource management techniques to optimize system performance and utilization.

## Architecture

The concurrent multi-client communication system is designed with the following components:

1. **Server**: Responsible for managing client connections, processing incoming requests, and coordinating communication between clients.

2. **Client**: Each client interacts with the server to send and receive data. Clients can operate concurrently and independently.

3. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Enables communication between the server and clients using shared memory segments or other suitable IPC mechanisms.

4. **Shared Memory**: Utilized to store shared data, enhancing data access and communication efficiency.

5. **Multithreading**: The server uses multithreading to handle multiple client connections concurrently, distributing client loads on individual threads.

6. **Mutex Synchronization**: Advanced mutex synchronization mechanisms are implemented to ensure thread safety and prevent data conflicts when multiple clients access shared resources simultaneously.

## Usage

Please follow the instructions below to run the concurrent multi-client communication system:

1. Compile the server and client files using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).

2. Run the server executable to start the server:
   ``bash ./server.o && ./client.o``
3. Follow the menu driven instruction to request an operation from the server. Run multiple instances of clients with new names for concurrent connections.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance the functionality, performance, and scalability of the concurrent multi-client communication system are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
